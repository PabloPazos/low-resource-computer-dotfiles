# config

## About
- This are some configuration files for a basic Arch Linux setup. Use them as reference to create your own setup with the programs you like.
- The idea is to have a referencial floor when you install the programs and then you can move on your way.

## Why this programs?
- The idea about to work with this programs is the relative low resources they need. Around 300mb RAM when the SO is up. So, with something like an i3 and 4GB ram you will not notice about low performance.

## Is it worth?
For sure the idea of work with a windows managers and console instead a graphical enviroment is quite challenging, but totally woth to go. Will be slow initially, but over time will be faster and faster, even than a normal work flow.

## The programs:
- Alacritty: Alacritty is a free and open-source GPU accelerated terminal emulator focused on performance and simplicity. 
- bspwm: bspwm is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree. bspwm supports multiple monitors and is configured and controlled through messages.
- Compton: Compton is a compositor for X, and a fork of xcompmgr-dana.
- Dunst: is a lightweight replacement for the notification daemons provided by most desktop environments.
- ncspot: a low resources unofficial spotify client for console.
- nvim: Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim. A replacement for visual studio code. Quite difficult to use initially, but REALLY worth it.
- Polybar: aims to help users build beautiful and highly customizable status bars for their desktop environment, without the need of having a black belt in shell scripting. 
- sxhkd: a simple X hotkey daemon, by the developer of bspwm, that reacts to input events by executing commands.
